⚙️ Comparative Analysis of Ripple Carry Adders with Low Power Analysis

> A Final Year VLSI Design project focused on comparing the power and performance characteristics of different Ripple Carry Adder architectures using Verilog HDL and simulation tools.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and compare the performance of various **Ripple Carry Adders (RCAs)** designed using Verilog. The core focus is on **low power optimization** techniques such as transistor sizing, clock gating, and power gating. The comparative study includes measurement of **power consumption**, **delay**, and **area** to identify the most efficient RCA design in a VLSI context.
